# Scratch File

Possible file structure...  we have one file in /gap_fill_make for filling in gaps and another one for creating gaps.

We could create a 3rd execution .py program, importing the other 2 in order to combine the functions into one Py executon file.

For ease of import into the final combination function (`gap_fill_make_021918_1.py`) you'll want to wrap all of the code in the imported "fill" and "make" files in their own function.
